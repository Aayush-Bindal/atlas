# changes proposed

- audio thing will be optional
- each picture will be tagged with a sticker on a corner that portrays an emotion like animated crying emoji or laughting emoji or angry emoji etc (LLM sentiment)
- maximum context is extracted from image metadata like geolocation and time and phone etc
- business target: travel agencies as well, we can charge from them to advertise their business

# future scope

- the images uploaded are clustered by these contextual similarities (such as location and event and lighting and mood etc) and AI can use these other people's context as a context for the new story

- people can enable public sharing to create public threads of stories for events, the AI will arrange images by time and create a shared story for those present at that location, like a blend

- reels of these stories that are scrollable
